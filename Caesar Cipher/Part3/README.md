# Part 3 - Enhanced Features

This part enhances the project by adding user input validation, handling of non-alphabet characters, and the ability to restart the cipher program.

## Code Overview

- **User Input**: The program now accepts input that can include numbers, symbols, and spaces.
- **Functionality**: It checks if a character is part of the alphabet before shifting.
```
### Code Snippet

```python
if letter not in alphabet:
    outputText += letter
else:
    # Shift logic
```
