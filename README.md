# Caesar Cipher Project

This project implements a Caesar cipher, which is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. The project is divided into three parts, each demonstrating different functionalities of the cipher.

## Parts Overview

1. **Part 1 - Encryption**: This part includes the basic functionality to encrypt a given message using a shift amount.
2. **Part 2 - Decryption**: This part adds the ability to decrypt a previously encrypted message.
3. **Part 3 - Enhanced Features**: This part incorporates user input handling and the ability to restart the cipher program.

## Getting Started

To run the project, clone the repository and navigate to the folder in your terminal. Execute the `task.py` script to start using the Caesar cipher.

```bash
git clone [repository-url]
cd [repository-folder]
python task.py
```
